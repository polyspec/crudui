# Runtime packages

[한국어](runtime-packages.ko.md).
Implementation and verification are recorded in [feature status](../features.md).

## Required capabilities

JavaScript, PHP, Go and Rust provide specification composition, form structure
compilation, data binding, HTML rendering and validation. PHP native execution
provides both form generation and validation. A server language can render forms
without starting a JavaScript server or invoking another language's executable.

- **CURP-001** JavaScript — Composition and expressions: required; Form compilation and binding: required; Form HTML, list and detail rendering: required; Validation: required
- **CURP-002** PHP — Composition and expressions: required; Form compilation and binding: required; Form HTML, list and detail rendering: required; Validation: required
- **CURP-003** Go — Composition and expressions: required; Form compilation and binding: required; Form HTML, list and detail rendering: required; Validation: required
- **CURP-004** Rust — Composition and expressions: required; Form compilation and binding: required; Form HTML, list and detail rendering: required; Validation: required
- **CURP-005** PHP native extension — Composition and expressions: required; Form compilation and binding: required; Form HTML, list and detail rendering: required; Validation: required

These items define requirements, not completed implementation. The PHP extension
may share compiled libraries, but both operations execute inside the PHP process.
PHP packages and the extension implement the same public classes. An enabled
extension registers those classes before any script runs; otherwise,
Composer autoloads the PHP implementation. The [PHP API contract](../operations/php-extension.md)
defines loading and method equality. Comparison tests run PHP and native PHP in
separate processes and verify which implementation actually executed. An
unavailable native module fails the native test target.

## API operations

Names use each language's naming convention. The operations and results remain
the same; no runtime selector is embedded in a field specification.

- **CURP-006** Compile structure — JavaScript: `compileForm`; PHP library: `Generator::compileForm`; Go: `CompileForm`; Rust: `compile_form`; PHP native: `Generator::compileForm`
- **CURP-007** Bind data — JavaScript: `bindForm`; PHP library: `Generator::bindForm`; Go: `BindForm`; Rust: `bind_form`; PHP native: `Generator::bindForm`
- **CURP-008** Bind buttons — JavaScript: `bindButtons`; PHP library: `Generator::bindButtons`; Go: `BindButtons`; Rust: `bind_buttons`; PHP native: `Generator::bindButtons`
- **CURP-009** Render buttons — JavaScript: `formButtonsHtml`; PHP library: `Generator::formButtonsHtml`; Go: `FormButtonsHTML`; Rust: `form_buttons_html`; PHP native: `Generator::formButtonsHtml`
- **CURP-010** Create instance — JavaScript: `createForm`; PHP library: `new Form`; Go: `NewForm`; Rust: `Form::new`; PHP native: `new Form`
- **CURP-011** Replace data — JavaScript: `setData`; PHP library: `$form->setData`; Go: `SetData`; Rust: `set_data`; PHP native: `$form->setData`
- **CURP-012** Read data — JavaScript: `getData`; PHP library: `$form->getData`; Go: `GetData`; Rust: `get_data`; PHP native: `$form->getData`
- **CURP-013** Render form — JavaScript: `renderForm`; PHP library: `Generator::renderForm`; Go: `RenderForm`; Rust: `render_form`; PHP native: `Generator::renderForm`
- **CURP-014** Build list — JavaScript: `buildList`; PHP library: `Generator::buildList`; Go: `BuildList`; Rust: `build_list`; PHP native: `Generator::buildList`
- **CURP-015** Render list — JavaScript: `renderList`; PHP library: `Generator::renderList`; Go: `RenderList`; Rust: `render_list`; PHP native: `Generator::renderList`
- **CURP-016** Build detail — JavaScript: `buildDetail`; PHP library: `Generator::buildDetail`; Go: `BuildDetail`; Rust: `build_detail`; PHP native: `Generator::buildDetail`
- **CURP-017** Render detail — JavaScript: `renderDetail`; PHP library: `Generator::renderDetail`; Go: `RenderDetail`; Rust: `render_detail`; PHP native: `Generator::renderDetail`
- **CURP-018** Validate — JavaScript: `validate`; PHP library: `Validator::validate`; Go: `Validate`; Rust: `validate`; PHP native: `Validator::validate`

Every runtime builds the same detail model and writes the same detail HTML. The
[shared detail fixture](../../tests/fixtures/detail-render/README.md) is compared at both
levels in JavaScript, the HTML renderer, the PHP library, Go, Rust and the PHP extension:
the `buildDetail` model with its member order, and the `renderDetail` HTML byte for byte
with React's server rendering.

Both PHP implementations use the classes `Polyspec\Crudui\Generator`,
`Polyspec\Crudui\Validator` and `Polyspec\Crudui\Form`. The
[PHP API contract](../operations/php-extension.md) defines the common methods and
loading order. The extension registers these classes when enabled. Without the
extension, Composer autoloads the PHP classes. Examples use the same calls in
both configurations; comparison tests use separate PHP processes and verify
class provenance and method signatures.

## Shared contracts and separate responsibilities

All runtimes implement the same [schema](schema.md), [expressions](expressions.md),
[validation rules](validation-rules.md), [form runtime](form-runtime.md) and
[input text](input-text.md) rules.
Within each runtime, generation and validation reuse composition and expression
evaluation. Rendering does not redefine requiredness or validation rules.

1. **CURP-019** Compilation resolves references and prepares the complete form structure
   without record data. The output can be serialized and cached.
2. **CURP-020** An instance owns record values, defaults, row identities and row operations.
   Instances do not modify shared templates.
3. **CURP-021** Binding evaluates field values, localization and design against instance data.
4. **CURP-022** Rendering creates HTML from evaluated fields. Validation receives submitted
   record data and reports validation or specification errors.
5. **CURP-023** Browser binding applies user input and row actions. Server runtimes do not
   implement browser focus, selection or scroll behavior.

Server rendering and static delivery are both supported.
Rendering can use data on the server, or load a cached structure in the
browser and inject data later. Neither configuration changes the schema, record
structure or validation rules.

## Data and interoperability

Compiled templates share one JSON contract across runtimes. A template compiled
by one runtime can be bound by another without modification. Template field order
and keyed record order are preserved. An unordered host-language map cannot be
used to infer a lost declaration or row order.

The [ordered JSON procedure](../operations/ordered-json.md) defines transport
verification. Ordered JSON object members become ordered runtime objects;
arrays remain arrays. Absent values, `null`, empty objects and empty arrays remain
distinct. Runtime conversion does not introduce identity or ordering fields.

Repeated row keys identify rows within their parent collection. Saved sequences,
new keys, ordering and scoped row operations follow the form runtime contract in
every implementation. Invalid operations leave both data and evaluated fields
unchanged.
