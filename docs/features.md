# Feature status

[한국어](features.ko.md). Contracts are defined in [spec](spec/form-runtime.md).
Tests and deployment are recorded separately. `pending` is not a passing result.

| ID | Feature | Implementation | Verification | Deployment | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| control-attributes | Declared `attributes` of a field's control and its node written as attributes in eight renderers, limited to `data-*` and `aria-*` names | in-progress | pending | not-deployed | [Specification](spec/schema.md#declared-attributes), [form markup](spec/form-markup.md#declared-attributes); implemented in `@crudui/generator-core` ([model and check cases](../packages/generator-core/src/declared-attributes.test.ts)) and `@crudui/generator-html` ([byte cases](../packages/generator-html/src/declared-attributes.test.ts)) and the JSON Schema; React, Vue and Svelte write them only on a checkbox or [switch](spec/form-markup.md#switches) input; React, Vue, Svelte for the other controls and nodes, PHP, the PHP extension, Go and Rust remain, and the shared form cases are added when every renderer is implemented |
| switch-control | A `switcher` field rendered as a switch (`role="switch"`) distinct from a checkbox in eight renderers | in-progress | pending | not-deployed | [Form markup](spec/form-markup.md#switches); implemented in `@crudui/generator-core` ([model cases](../packages/generator-core/src/switch-control.test.ts)), `@crudui/generator-html` ([byte cases](../packages/generator-html/src/switch-control.test.ts)), React ([byte case](../packages/generator-react/src/__tests__/switch-control.test.ts)), Vue ([case](../packages/generator-vue/test/switch-control.test.mjs)), Svelte ([case](../packages/generator-svelte/test/switch-control.test.mjs)) and the stylesheet ([browser check](../tests/form-styles.test.mjs)); the shared form case `switcher-bare` expects the switch, and PHP, the PHP extension, Go and Rust fail it until they are implemented |
| range-control | A `range` field rendered as a slider with its bounds, step and current value in eight renderers and validated in five validators | in-progress | pending | not-deployed | [Specification](spec/schema.md#range-fields), [form markup](spec/form-markup.md#range-fields); implemented in `@crudui/generator-core` ([model and check cases](../packages/generator-core/src/range-control.test.ts)), `@crudui/generator-html` ([byte cases](../packages/generator-html/src/range-control.test.ts)), the stylesheet and the JSON Schema; the existing `range` and `step` rules validate the value ([TypeScript cases](../packages/validator-ts/src/range-field.test.ts), [shared validation case](../tests/fixtures/validate/numeric-rules.ts) `range-field-values`); React, Vue and Svelte render it, and the [shared form cases](../tests/fixtures/form-render/gen-cases.mts) `range-*` compare them; PHP, the PHP extension, Go and Rust renderers remain and fail those cases until they are implemented |
| button-control | A `button` field rendered as a `button` element with its content and attributes and no script in eight renderers | in-progress | pending | not-deployed | [Form markup](spec/form-markup.md#button-fields); implemented in `@crudui/generator-core` ([model cases](../packages/generator-core/src/button-control.test.ts)), `@crudui/generator-html` ([byte cases](../packages/generator-html/src/button-control.test.ts)), React ([byte cases](../packages/generator-react/src/__tests__/button-control.test.ts), [script check](../tests/widget-scripts.test.mjs)), Vue ([cases](../packages/generator-vue/test/button-control.test.mjs)), Svelte ([cases](../packages/generator-svelte/test/button-control.test.mjs)) and the stylesheet ([browser layout check](../tests/form-styles.test.mjs)); the shared form cases `button-empty`, `action-alias` and `button-behavior-onclick` expect the button element, and PHP, the PHP extension, Go and Rust, which still write the script, the hidden input and the input button and the widget member `buttonText`, fail them until they are implemented |
| choice-appearance | A class and style for each choice of a choice field in eight renderers, so a choice field can render as a grid of swatches | in-progress | pending | not-deployed | [Specification](spec/schema.md#choice-appearance), [form markup](spec/form-markup.md#choice-appearance); implemented in `@crudui/generator-core` ([model and check cases](../packages/generator-core/src/choice-appearance.test.ts)) and `@crudui/generator-html` ([byte cases](../packages/generator-html/src/choice-appearance.test.ts)) and the JSON Schema; React, Vue, Svelte, PHP, the PHP extension, Go and Rust remain, and the shared form cases are added when every renderer is implemented |
| choice-groups | Group entries in the choice list of a `select` field rendered as `optgroup` elements with their options in eight renderers, and the values inside groups accepted as the field's choices by `in` in five validators | in-progress | pending | not-deployed | [Specification](spec/schema.md#choice-groups), [form markup](spec/form-markup.md#choice-groups); implemented in `@crudui/generator-core` ([model and check cases](../packages/generator-core/src/choice-groups.test.ts)), `@crudui/generator-html` ([byte cases](../packages/generator-html/src/choice-groups.test.ts)), React ([byte and component cases](../packages/generator-react/src/__tests__/choice-groups.test.tsx)), Vue ([cases](../packages/generator-vue/test/choice-groups.test.mjs)), Svelte ([cases](../packages/generator-svelte/test/choice-groups.test.mjs)), the TypeScript validator's `in` ([cases](../packages/validator-ts/src/choice-groups.test.ts)), its types and the JSON Schema; the PHP, the PHP extension, Go and Rust renderers and the PHP, Go and Rust validators remain, and the shared form and validation cases are added when every implementation accepts groups |
| inline-layout | A form layout that places each field's label and control on one row in eight renderers | in-progress | pending | not-deployed | [Specification](spec/schema.md#layout), [form markup](spec/form-markup.md#layout); implemented in `@crudui/generator-core` ([model and check cases](../packages/generator-core/src/inline-layout.test.ts)), `@crudui/generator-html` ([byte cases](../packages/generator-html/src/inline-layout.test.ts)), the stylesheet ([browser layout check](../tests/form-styles.test.mjs)) and the JSON Schema; the label of a checkbox or switcher field in the header of an inline layout is implemented in the node model and in React ([server and component cases](../packages/generator-react/src/__tests__/inline-layout.test.tsx)), Vue ([cases](../packages/generator-vue/test/inline-layout.test.mjs)) and Svelte ([cases](../packages/generator-svelte/test/inline-layout.test.mjs)); PHP, the PHP extension, Go and Rust remain, including that label, and the shared form cases are added when every renderer is implemented |

## Current comparison deployment verification

On 2026-09-19 the comparison deployment verification ran in 5m20s with zero failures.
The current `main` tree is served by the comparison deployment. PHP, PHP extension, Go and Rust
passed 450 generation checks, 120 persistence checks and 7,008 browser checks, and the canonical
flow passed all 40 combinations of five servers, four clients and both initializations, with zero
failures. The run started from repositories holding non-default records, so every initialization
column loaded its own reset record. Every browser report and phase completed within its own limit,
and the container reported zero zombie processes after verification. The public root is the
canonical page: list, detail, form, save and refreshed list; the separate benchmark screen is
`/benchmark-console/`. The 45-record canonical list uses three pages of 20, 20 and 5 records.
Page-level SSR contains the selected server's list, detail or form markup, while CSR contains only
the stage shell that the selected client fills. Initialization comparison preserves
framework-owned container markers and compares rendered container contents; Vue's `data-v-app` is
not removed.

## Display declaration verification

On 2026-09-24 the working tree of the display declaration change passed on macOS arm64 with PHP
8.5.10, Node.js 26.8.1, Go 1.27.0 and Rust 1.98.0:

- The native generator suite passed 596 checks in each of JavaScript, the HTML renderer, PHP, Go,
  Rust and native PHP (3,576 in total, zero failed), including the 142 list and 44 detail cases.
- The form packages passed core 247, HTML 406, React 794, Vue 597, Svelte 590 and 14 mounted
  Svelte checks, and the node form checks passed 57 and 24. The generator packages passed 249 PHP, 116 Go and 36 Rust
  tests, and the PHP extension suite passed 46 tests; its address-sanitizer test runs on Linux.
- The cross-check console passed 1,039 tests, the specification CLI 38, the form-comparison source
  suite 194, its Go and Rust servers 14 and 18, `npm run manifest:test` 21 commands,
  `npm run test:packages` seven steps and `npm run test:runtimes` 65 tests. `npm run spec:schema`,
  `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `make format-check` and `make docs-check` passed.

## Native package verification

On 2026-09-17 the working tree passed `make ci`, which runs every checking command of the CI
workflow and checks the conformance evidence against `contracts/features.json`, on macOS arm64 with
PHP 8.5.10, Node.js 26.8.1, Go 1.27.0 and Rust 1.98.1:

- The validators passed 580 JavaScript, 698 PHP, 587 Go and 111 Rust tests, each including all 250
  shared validation cases, and the 80 shared input-text cases across the validation and generation
  operations. The PHP extension suite passed 42 tests; its address-sanitizer test runs on Linux.
- The shared generator report passed 501 checks in each of JavaScript, the HTML renderer, PHP, Go,
  Rust and native PHP (3,006 in total, zero failed), and its inputs did not change during the run.
  The generator packages passed 240 PHP, 115 Go and 35 Rust tests.
- The cross-check console passed 914 tests, which send every shared validation, list, detail and
  input-text case and the request cases through all five validator processes.
- The form packages passed core 216, HTML 308, React 502, Vue 472, Svelte 467 and twelve mounted
  Svelte checks; the specification CLI passed 38; the node form checks passed 54, including the
  stylesheet layout in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. The form-comparison source suite passed 149
  checks, `npm run lint` reported no problem across the repository, the package install check seven steps, and `make format-check` passed.
- In the Linux toolchain image the PHP extension engine passed 33 tests, including the
  address-sanitizer and comma-decimal-locale runs. The Linux stylesheet checks in Chromium, Firefox
  and WebKit run in the CI job that runs the form tests.

Conformance is checked from evidence. Every suite that runs a shared fixture records which feature,
fixture case and runtime passed, and `make conformance` (and the final CI job) compares that evidence
with `contracts/features.json`: a supported runtime without a passing record for every declared case
fails. [Conformance](spec/conformance.md) defines the standard. The packages, the PHP extension and
the comparison service are not deployed.

## Retained form comparison results

The retained external environment at `https://crudui.test/` uses an earlier library tree,
with PHP, PHP with native JSON parsing, Go and Rust as separate HTTP targets.
All 240 HTTP checks and PHP processor-mode enforcement passed.
Both PHP targets use the PHP validator. These retained results do not verify the
current native CRUDUI form generation or validation integration.

| Server | Scenarios | Interactions | Page errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PHP | 120/120 passed | 30/30 passed | 0 |
| PHP with native JSON parsing | 120/120 passed | 30/30 passed | 0 |
| Go | 120/120 passed | 30/30 passed | 0 |
| Rust | 120/120 passed | 30/30 passed | 0 |

Each target covers React, Vue and Svelte with form and ordered JSON transport.
Reports include initial data, later injection, repeated injection, record
restoration, raw HTML, DOM, CSS, control state and row operations. Evidence is
stored in the external comparison workspace under
`.form-comparison/results-<revision>/report-<server>.json`.
Report metadata records source revisions. A total of 108 interaction checks includes all four comparison
modes; 30 belong to the current implementation.

Between the library tree and the verified tree, five TypeScript files changed
only API comments and an unused type import; their executable JavaScript is identical. Generated PHP
dependencies and the Go binary were removed from Git. The new image installs the
same locked PHP dependency versions and builds the server binaries from source.

The current deployment reuses the running comparison container when its image and
mount contract match. Source synchronization preserves container inspection,
project routes, proxy state, certificates, stored files, HTML, health and load
responses. Container creation is limited to bootstrap or an explicit image/mount
contract change.

Retained comparison implementations have diagnostic failures. Their failures
remain in the reports and cause the complete comparison runner to return a
nonzero status. A passing current implementation does not make those retained
implementations pass. Earlier reports do not verify the current dependency graph.

## Deployment

Library deployment means package publication; no package is published.
The table records completed browser checks for all four servers.
Retained implementation failures remain in the reports.

TypeScript, Go, Rust and PHP API generation and the strict static web build
passed. Two complete generations produced identical API documentation, native
HTML assets and schema output. Eight generator failure tests passed, and the raw
form inspector passed 18 cases.
