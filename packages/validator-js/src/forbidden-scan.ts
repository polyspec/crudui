/**
 * Recursive forbidden meta-key scan (schema §6) — the runtime half of the
 * global rejection that the meta-schema's `propertyNames` enforces statically.
 *
 * R1: the types/parser PRESERVE every key (round-trip), so blocking forbidden
 * meta keys is the VALIDATION layer's job, not the model's. The direct audit
 * found that the Go/Rust typed models only rejected forbidden keys at the top
 * level and one level under open buckets — a deeply nested meta key
 * (`validate.required.if`, `options.x.display_switch`, …) leaked through. This
 * scan closes that leak: it walks the COMPOSED single spec (after `$ref`/`$patch`
 * expansion and x-strip) to ARBITRARY depth and rejects a forbidden key found at
 * ANY depth — including one level under a slot/bucket body.
 *
 * Placement (schema §2 pipeline): this runs in the spec LOAD path, immediately
 * after compose expansion and before validation entry. A hit is therefore a LOAD
 * failure (`ComposeLoadError`, code `FORBIDDEN_META_KEY`) — the spec never comes
 * into existence — never a `valid:false` validation result.
 *
 * Forbidden set (schema §6): the enumerated `FORBIDDEN_META_KEYS`
 * (condition-only / legacy / magic-symbol meta keys) PLUS the `x{key}` comment
 * family (any `x`-prefixed key). `$ref`/`$patch` are NOT forbidden — compose
 * already consumed them, so they do not survive to here; `x{key}` IS strip-
 * eligible, so any `x{key}` that survives to this scan is rejected (the strip
 * belongs to the meta-schema; survival means it was not stripped).
