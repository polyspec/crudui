/**
 * Composition load errors (SPEC §5, §7; unresolved_behavior).
 *
 * Composition is a pre-processing pass that runs BEFORE validation/render: the
 * parser expands `$ref`/`$patch` into a single spec first (G5). An unresolved
 * composition is therefore NOT a validation failure (`valid:false`) — it is a
 * LOAD FAILURE: the spec itself does not come into existence. An unresolved
 * `$ref` never passes as `valid:true`. Every throw here is a load error,
 * distinct from a later validation error.
 *
 * Load errors:
 *   (1) $ref file missing
 *   (2) $ref format error
 *   (3) detectKey absent
 *   (4) $ref cycle (A→B→A)
 *   (5) $patch target/op error
