"""The shared composition fixtures against the Python compose engine.

Every case of `tests/fixtures/compose/cases.json` composes its entry through
`compose_properties` or `compose_spec` with the recorded files and basepath:
a result case reproduces the composed map (compared with sorted member names,
which the other harnesses canonicalize the same way; arrays keep their order),
and an error case raises `ComposeLoadError` with the recorded code.
