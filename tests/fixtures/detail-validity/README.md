# Detail validity fixtures

[한국어](README.ko.md).

`cases.json` cases share one shape with the other structure validity families
([form](../spec-validity/README.md), [list](../list-validity/README.md) and
[detail](../detail-validity/README.md)): `{ name, note, spec, files?, expect, reason?, engine }`.

- `expect` is the meta-schema result for `#/definitions/Detail` in the [meta-schema](../../../schema/crudui.schema.json), `"ok"` or `"fail"`.
- `reason` is present only on a `"fail"` case and is required there. It names an Ajv keyword that
  must appear among the errors.
- `engine` is the runtime structure validation result. `"pass"` means no load failure and the result
  `{ valid: true, errors: [] }`; `{ code, at }` is the load failure code and the composition trace
  joined with `.`.
- `files` is the composition file set that every runtime consumer passes to the engine. The
  meta-schema reads `spec` alone.

The two results are independent. Every consumer applies every member it owns: no consumer classifies
cases itself or supplies its own files. [`check-schema.mjs`](../../../scripts/check-schema.mjs), run by
`npm run spec:schema`, asserts this shape for all three families before it checks `expect` and
`reason`.

`sortable` on a field and a root `$ref` without its own `fields` fail the meta-schema and pass the
runtime, while an unresolved `$ref` passes the meta-schema and fails the runtime. A forbidden key
introduced by `$patch` fails both.

These cases check a basic detail, composed fields, forbidden keys as a field key, on a field, in
format options and at the detail root, `show_if` on a field and an unresolved `fields` reference.
The runtime codes are `FORBIDDEN_META_KEY` and `REF_FILE_NOT_FOUND`.

## Comparisons

The [detail meta-schema test](../../../packages/validator-ts/src/detail-metaschema.conformance.test.ts)
and `check-schema.mjs` compile the detail entry point and check `expect` and `reason`.

The runtime tests validate `spec` with `files`, read no record data and compare `engine`. The Rust
structure API returns `Ok(())` for `"pass"`, its equivalent of `{ valid: true, errors: [] }`. The
cross-check console sends every case to its five validator processes, which exit `0` with the clean
result or `2` with `{ error, code, at }`, and requires the same result, code and location from each.

Runtime consumers are the detail validation tests in
[TypeScript](../../../packages/validator-ts/src/validate-detail/validate-detail.conformance.test.ts),
[PHP](../../../packages/validator-php/tests/Validate/DetailValidateConformanceTest.php),
[Go](../../../packages/validator-go/validator/validate/detail_conformance_test.go),
[Rust](../../../packages/validator-rust/tests/detail_validity_conformance.rs), the
[PHP extension engine test](../../../packages/php-ext/tests/engine.test.mjs), the
[PHP extension runner](../../../packages/php-ext/tests/validate.php) and the cross-check console
[detail runner test](../../../examples/cross-check-console/server/validate-detail-runner.test.mjs) and
[validator process test](../../../examples/cross-check-console/server/validator-processes.test.mjs).

## Regeneration

There is no generator; the cases are written by hand. Keep `expect` and `reason` consistent with the
detail definitions in the meta-schema, and `engine` consistent with composition and the forbidden-key
scan of every runtime. A composed case must carry every referenced file in `files`. Run the
meta-schema check and every runtime consumer after changing a case.
